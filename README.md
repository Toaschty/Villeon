## About the Game
Villeon is a 2D RPG set in a medieval world with plenty of exploration and combat. Discover a lively Village and battle your way through challenging Dungeons.

In the Village, chat with residents to learn more about the story or trade with them to make your character stronger.
In the Dungeon, fight through procedurally generated rooms full of enemies and obstacles. Reach the end, defeat the boss, and rescue captured villagers!
